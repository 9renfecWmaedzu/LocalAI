## How to Install LR/Mogrify 2
 
To install LR/Mogrify 2, you need to download and install two components: the plugin itself and ImageMagick, a collection of powerful, freeware command line utilities for processing images that the plugin uses[^4^].
 
First, download the plugin from [this link](https://photographers-toolbox.com/products/lrmogrify2.php) and unzip it to a folder of your choice. Then, open Lightroom Classic and go to File > Plugin Manager. Click Add and browse to the folder where you unzipped the plugin. Select the file called lrmogrify2.lrplugin and click Add Plugin.
 
Next, download ImageMagick from [this link](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) and install it on your computer. Make sure you choose the version that matches your operating system and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). If you are using Windows, you need to download and install ImageMagick 7[^4^].
 
After installing ImageMagick, go back to Lightroom Classic and open the Plugin Manager again. Select LR/Mogrify 2 from the list of plugins and click Enable. Then, click on the ImageMagick tab and browse to the folder where you installed ImageMagick. Select the file called magick.exe (or mogrify.exe if you are using an older version of ImageMagick) and click OK.
 
You have now successfully installed LR/Mogrify 2 and you are ready to use it.
 
## How to Use LR/Mogrify 2
 
To use LR/Mogrify 2, you need to create an export preset that includes the plugin settings. You can do this by going to File > Export or by clicking on the Export button in the Library module. In the Export dialog box, choose a destination folder for your exported images and select a file format and quality settings as usual.
 
Then, scroll down to the Post-Process Actions section and check the box next to LR/Mogrify 2. You will see a list of options that you can use to embellish your images. You can add one or more of these options by clicking on the + button next to each option name. You can also reorder them by dragging them up or down in the list. The order of these options matters because they are applied sequentially from top to bottom.
 
For example, if you want to add a watermark, a border and a text annotation to your images, you can add these three options in this order:
 
- Watermarking - allows you to add a text or image watermark to your images. You can choose the watermark content, position, size, opacity, angle and blending mode.
- Borders - allows you to add an outer or inner border (or both) to your images. You can choose the border color, width, style and position.
- Text Annotation - allows you to add a text annotation to your images. You can choose the text content, font, size, color, position, angle and blending mode.

For each option, you can click on the Edit button to customize its settings. You can also use tokens (such as filename, date, camera, etc.) to insert dynamic information into your watermark or text annotation content.
 
After adding and configuring the options you want, you can save
